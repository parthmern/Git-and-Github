# Git-and-Github

### ❤️ What is Git ?
➔ Free and openSource version control system ( vcs means tools that help to track changes in code ) <br/>
➔ VCS track history and it helps to collaborate <br/>

### ❤️ What is GitHub ?
➔ Website where we host repositories online <br/>
➔ we can also track our initiate , update , delete history. <br/>
➔ generally we create files/folders using mouse but we can create them using terminal. Likewise, we can directly upload on github but a good developer prefer to do changes using Terminal. <br/>

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### 💚 Using Git
➔ Git is already installed in macOs and Linux. But, in windows we are installing Git-Bash which already have git <br/>
➔ check that git installed or not `git --version` if any version available then git is installed <br/>
<br/>
➔ ways to use git
1) Command line -- popular way
2) IDE/code editors like VScode
3) Graphical user interface like GitKraken

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━<br/>
<br/>
⚠️**Note**- everywhere in codes if i am using <name> means you have to write proper thing at something expect < , > like ` " <name> " ` so the answer of this is ` "parth" ` <br/>
<br/>

### 💛 Configuring Git

✔️ `git config --global user.name "<userName>"` (write username at userName)<br/>
✔️ `git config --global user.email "<someone@gmail.com>" `(enter your email) <br/>
✔️ `git config --list` (to check that details are saved or not )<br/>

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### 💙 Git with VScode
➔ we can also open intergrated terminal with vscode (From the menu, use the Terminal > New Terminal or View > Terminal menu commands)<br/>
➔ same as terminal/git-bash <br/>

### 💚 Basic commands

✔️ `git clone <link>` = clone = cloning a repository on our local machine <br/>
💤 *how to generate links - go to the repo on gitHub and there is button named CODE click there and copy HTTPS link*  <br/>
<br/>
✔️ `git status` = status = display the state of code <br/>
<br/>

✔️ `git add <fileName>` = adds new or changed files in working directory to the git staging area  <br/>
✔️ `git commit -m "some message"` = record the change <br/>
✔️ `git push origin main`  = upload local repo content to remote repo <br/>
<br/>
♻️ first clone the github repo on local machine , then check git status , if any file which created newly is untracked then do git add then if we do some changes in that file then again do git commit means save , then if we want to push/upload this file on github then do git push origin main
